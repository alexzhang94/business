CONCLUSION final conclusion


On the grounds of acquired observation, the author concludes that ___. It may ring true without close scrutiny. We could, however, find that it turns out to be overwhelmed by fallacies, if we take a close look at the connection between the author’s evidences and conclusion. These specious evidences undermine the reliability of the author’s conclusion.

For one thing, based on [AR], the author assumes that [AS] and derives that [AC]. 
Although there are some possibilities that / to do … in some way, it is rather cursory/ impetuous to extrapolate that… invariably… 
Alternative explanations are obtainable as …
To reach the cited conclusion, the arguer must explain either why none of these alternatives is available or why none of them is able to sustain.

For another thing, the author employs [AR] to justify [AC]. The problem is that the author take [AS] for granted without any justification. 
Available interpretations includes [AR] but are not confined to this possibility. 
For the sake of solidity, we are supposed to take all the possibilities into account rather than focus on any specific factor and thus overlook other ones or the potential interactions between them.

Further more, the argument rest on the assumption that [AS]. This is a fallacious reasoning which can weaken the argument unless ……
Only in the circumstance that …, … is desirable. In order to qualify this assumption, we have to cast more constraints on …, but things in fact are not so obvious. Over-simplification might belie the presumable intricate interrelations underlying the superficial scenario.

Moreover, according to the author, [AC] is the corollary of [AR]. One might be disposed to take issue with the author’s assumption that [AS].
It is reasonable to doubt that what the arguer assumes will not happen in reality.

Conclusively, the course of the author’s reasoning teems with loopholes. 
More convincing evidences and detailed discussion are expected to (take every possible consideration into account)/ (weigh a variety of alternatives as many as possible), thereby strengthen the conclusion and increase the credibility of the author’s conclusion
