It sounds plausible at first glance. However, if we take a close look at the connection between the author’s evidence and conclusion, we will find the author’s argument is (rife with)/(overwhelmed by) fallacies. Therefore it’s persuasiveness has been weaken in large part by these flaws.

The reasoning method the author take is questionable. 

……. is in the case. 

in any scenario, …… is by no means the best choice.

Therefore, facing such limited evidence, the conclusion is unwarranted.

 the author’s evidences are insufficient to support the conclusion.

The author employed some … to justify…

Alternative explanations are obtainable under……

It is reasonable to doubt that what the arguer assumes will not happen in reality.

To illustrate this point clearly

The arguer just simply assumes that [FALLACY] and neither any conclusive scientific evidence nor any anecdotal evidence is provided to affirm this assumption.

This is a fallacious reasoning unless the author can provide persuasive evidences to rule out any other possibilities.

To reach the cited conclusion, the arguer must explain either why none of these alternatives is available or　why none of them is able to sustain.

The meager evidence cannot sustain the argument proffered by the arguer.

We may assume that this factor can only function as only one percent of the causes and the rest 99 percent arise from…...
The factors making up the one percent may seem unimportant, and their cause may be correspondingly hard to determine. Yet, whether recognized or not, they will usually determine …… in a long run.

Studies of sth that focus on any specific factors and thus overlook potential interactions (between other possible causes ) may eventually/ultimately lead to (improper treatment)/(misunderstanding) of the

To sum up, the arguer’s argument mentioned above is not based on valid evidence or sound reasoning, neither of which is dispensable for a conclusive argument.

Conclusively, the course of the author’s reasoning teems with loopholes. 
More convincing evidences and detailed discussion are expected to increase the credibility of the author’s conclusion and take every possible consideration into account, thereby strengthen the conclusion.

The author employs some … to justify [FALLACY]

The arguer just simply assumes that [FALLACY] and neither any conclusive scientific evidence nor any anecdotal evidence is provided to affirm this assumption.

There is no guarantee that it is (necessary that) / (necessarily the case that) [FALLACY]

Another flaw that weakens this argument is that [FALLACY]
